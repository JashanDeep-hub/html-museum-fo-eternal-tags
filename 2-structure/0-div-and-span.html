  Exhibit: <div> and <span> — The Block and Inline Parasites

  These two tags do *nothing*. They exist purely to wrap other things.
  <div> is block-level. <span> is inline. That’s it.

    <title><div> and <span> — HTML’s Empty Shells</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>This is a <span>span</span> — it’s inline and useless unless styled. Which we’re not allowed to do.</p>
    <!-- <span>: wraps inline content. Useless without CSS or JS. -->

    <div>This is a div.</div>
    <div>It stacks vertically. That’s it.</div>
    <!-- <div>: block-level container. Also useless without CSS or JS. -->

    <p>People abuse <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for layout, content, styling, and everything else they don't understand.</p>
    <p>Modern developers call it “div soup.” Rightfully so.</p>
