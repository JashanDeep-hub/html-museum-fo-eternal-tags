    <p>This is <tt>teletype text</tt>. A leftover from when web pages looked like terminal screens.</p>
    <!-- <tt>: DEPRECATED. Monospace font. Use <code> or <pre>. Or just don’t. -->

    <p><blink>This text blinks in old versions of Firefox or Netscape. It’s dead now. Mostly.</blink></p>
    <!-- <blink>: DEPRECATED. Only worked in ancient Mozilla builds. Now it mocks you. -->

      This scrolling hell is brought to you by <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>

    <!-- <marquee>: DEPRECATED. But still works in many browsers. Moves text. Abused in the 2000s. -->

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> These tags are zombies. Don’t use them in production. But know that they exist. And they’re not going away anytime soon.</p>
