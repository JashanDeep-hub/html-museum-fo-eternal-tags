## 🔍 Overview

**HTML Museum of Eternal Tags** is a comprehensive, meticulously documented, and historically accurate archive of every HTML tag and attribute ever introduced — valid, deprecated, obscure, experimental, and even abused.

> This project is designed to teach, preserve, and expose the full capabilities and failures of HTML — without the interference of CSS or JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Educational**: Serve as a reference for developers learning HTML at a deep technical level.
- **Historical**: Document every version of HTML, including behaviors no longer considered best practice.
- **Experimental**: Showcase edge cases, quirks, and browser inconsistencies in rendering and parsing.
- **Accessible**: Fully self-contained `.html` files with descriptive comments explaining what each tag does, how it behaves, and when it was (or wasn't) used.
