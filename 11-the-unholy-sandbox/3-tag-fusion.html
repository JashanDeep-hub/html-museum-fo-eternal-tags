  Exhibit: Fusing tags by mistake — browser tries to guess
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Tag Fusion</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div><span<p>This is garbage. But it still shows up.</p>

    <!--
      <span<p> — Invalid combo. HTML parser autocorrects.
      You'll often see DOMs "fixing" this into something usable.
    -->

  </body>
</html>

  This example shows how HTML can "fuse" tags together when the syntax is incorrect.
  The browser tries to make sense of the malformed HTML and renders it anyway.
  This can lead to unexpected results, but it also demonstrates the flexibility of HTML parsing.
  It's a reminder that while HTML is forgiving, it's still best to write valid markup.
