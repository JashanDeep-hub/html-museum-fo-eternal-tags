  This example shows that HTML allows you to create custom tags.
  The browser doesn't care about the tag names, it just renders them.
  This can be useful for creating reusable components or for semantic purposes.
  However, these custom tags won't have any built-in behavior or styling unless you add it with JavaScript or CSS.
