<!--
  HTML is not case-sensitive. Tags can be UPPERCASE, lowercase, or rAnDoM.
  XHTML and XML **require lowercase**.
-->
<!--
  This example shows that HTML tags can be in any case.
  It demonstrates the flexibility of HTML syntax.
  However, XHTML and XML require lowercase tags.
  This is a common source of confusion for developers transitioning between HTML and XHTML/XML.
