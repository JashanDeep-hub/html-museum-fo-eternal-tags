  Exhibit: The <html> Element — The Root of All Markup

  This is the outermost tag. Every HTML file must start with it.
  Browsers will try to fix things if it’s missing — but don’t be an animal.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
<!--
  - lang: tells user agents the human language. Optional, but do it.
  - dir: text direction. Can be 'ltr' (left-to-right) or 'rtl' (right-to-left).
  - xmlns: namespace. Required for XHTML. Mostly ignored now.
  - xml:lang: XHTML-style language declaration. Redundant. Still here for pain.

    <title>The <html> Tag — Root of the Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is the root element. You wrap all HTML inside it — unless you're a clueless blog post from 2006.</p>
  </body>
</html>
