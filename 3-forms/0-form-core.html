  Exhibit: <form> — The Ritual Container of Input Suffering

  This is the wrapper that sends data into the void (or to your back-end if you have one. We don’t).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title><form> — The Pain Begins</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <form action="/hell" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" target="_blank" autocomplete="on" name="sufferingForm" novalidate>
      <!--
        action: where the data gets sent (usually ignored in demos)
        method: GET or POST. Or you're doing it wrong.
        enctype: multipart/form-data is required for file uploads.
        target: _blank opens response in a new tab (for chaos).
        autocomplete: enables or disables auto-fill.
        name: ancient attribute from pre-JS times.
        novalidate: disables browser validation. For true madness.
      -->

      <p><strong>This is the sacred <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> container. Everything you input goes here.</strong></p>

      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit to Doom">
    </form>

    <p>Even with nothing in it, a form carries a heavy legacy of brokenness across all browsers.</p>
